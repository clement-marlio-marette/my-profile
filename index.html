        <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-earth-africa"></i> Countries <i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i></h2>
        <p>As said previously, I lived in many countries during my youthness which gave me an open mindness, the ability to adapt to any environment and finally the taste of discovering unpopular places!</p>
        <p>Born in London, England <img src="images/uk flag.png" class="flag">, I travelled to Romania <img src="images/romania flag.png" class="flag">, where I stayed for 3 years. Later on, I flew to Africa where I lived 3 years in Cameroon <img src="images/cameroon flag.png" class="flag">. Then, I went back to my birth place, London, for 5 years. I mainly learned english during this stay. To continue, I crossed once again the Mediterranean Sea to the biggest country in Africa: Algeria <img src="images/algeria flag.png" class="flag">. Unknown from most people, I've lived there for 5 years. In my last expatriation with my parents, we travelled near the equator, to the Republic of Congo <img src="images/congo flag.png" class="flag">. Even though it was the shortest stay I've ever done, 1 year, it was so enriching! ... But the adventure NEVER stops! Once again, and here for the first time, I had the world on my hands, with countless destinations to choose, and the first one was in a continent I've never visited before, in a country that may be small but is very developped, I call it <b>Singapore</b> <img src="images/singapore flag.png" class="flag">!</p>

        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-car"></i> Driving <i class="fa-solid fa-motorcycle"></i></h3>
        <p>I am passionate about driving. It gives me this alone-time where I can enjoy speed and fun while listening to music. From looking at the beautiful views to being with friends and family, I simply miss when I am not able to drive.</p>
        <p>I got my driving license when I was only 16 in the Republic of Congo. There, the laws are very loose and it's very easy to obtain a driving license. However, recently, while in a holiday trip to Vietnam, I drove for the first time a motorcycle. It was scary at first, but very easy and exciting to drive. After only a few days of riding one, I am now confident to try and get a motorcycle driving license. And who knows, maybe in Congo <img src="images/wink.png" id="wink"></p>
